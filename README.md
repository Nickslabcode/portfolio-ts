Welcome to my minimalistic portfolio! Here, I showcase my current projects and will feature future ones as well. Each project has a detailed view with links, key features, screenshots, and setup instructions, which I retrieve from its respective GitHub repository‚Äôs README file using the Fetch API and render with custom styling through React Markdown.
